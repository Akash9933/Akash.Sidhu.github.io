            <h3>AI & AR Research Assistant - University of the Fraser Valley</h3>
            <h4><i>June 2020 - Feburary 2021</i></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Experimented with how AI and AR technology could be used to
                    help senior adults stay active and maintain a sense of well-being
                    while socially isolating during the Covid-19 pandemic</li>
                <li>Developed a program using Unity and C# that allowed doctors to
                    record and share virtual models of exercises with their patients.
                    Used an Azure Kinect camera to get joint data from user
                    movements. Translated data into readable Unity information to rig
                    an open source model. Wrote a C# script to allow the model to
                    react to real time data.
                    </li>
                <li>Developed an AI companion dog. Trained an AI model using real
                    world data to identify unique facial expressions. Used a Java API to
                    create responses to different expressions. Successfully
                    demonstrated the companion dog to university board members to
                    help acquire more funding for our research group.
                    </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Tutored students during classes. Spent extra time with students
                    after class to clarify concepts being taught, provide additional help
                    and examples, and support students working on assignments.</li>
