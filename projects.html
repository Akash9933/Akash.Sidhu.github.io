                    <p>Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I created a portoflio website to present my bio, skills and experience in languages alongside my created projects. With this
                        website, I aim to promote myself stronger when applying to job applications, and give a healthy boost to making myself a better candidate
                        to hire. Alongside, I am also further refining my skills in Full Stack to keep my learning and studying always going and improving. This portfolio project is 
                        my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                        <h2>AR Research Assistant Project</h2>
                        <p>Using Unity and C# I created a small prototype of an Augmented Reality app, using the Azure kinect device and C# scripts in an Unity enviorment. The prototype used the Azure kinects advanced camera to 
                            gather information of a person and their relative joint position and rotation. The camera took this information and calculated it using built in software and was able to print the information in a format 
                            that Unity could understand using the built in Avatar Bone Structure. With this, I wrote a script that would translate in real time the movements of a person through the camera and map the bones and joints onto the model in the 
                            Unity enviroment. Thus creating a result of controlling an Avatars movement using real life movement.

                    <h2>AI Research Assistant Project</h2>
                    <p>Using ROS (Robot Operating System) and an API for the Miro-e robot companion dog, we trained the AI of this robot to react to situations in the real world. The main interaction created was the ability for the robot to 
                        sense facial expressions. Using real world data to feed into the learning for the AI companion dog, it learnt what emotions looked like using cameras and act appropriately. Using the API coded in Java we coded how 
                        the robot should react to these expressions. If the person dispalyed a sad expression, the robot would come closer to the person to give comfort, and when it sensed it was being touched or petted, the robot dog would display 
                        a show of happiness and reasurance. With these interaction built, we demonstrated it to the university board members to have a showcase of our companion robot and display its interaction. Ending in a successful demonstration.

                    <h2>Arena Style Battle Game</h2>
                    <p>Using Java I created an Arena Style Battle Game for a school project. Using Object-Oriented Programming I tracked the players information, such as health, 
                        attack strength, experience, money and defense. Alongside the player information, I used Object-Oriented Programming to track information about the enemies and bosses in a simillar fashion. 
                        The game was designed for a Object-Oriented Modeling and Design course. The project was given full creativity to 
                        create any program we wished to creat while following guidelines the course required, such as the steps to creating an application. Alongside the project I created an 
                        Oral presentation showcasing the programs functionality alongside the guidelines the course required.

                    <h2>Classic Brick Breaker Game In Unity</h2>
                    <p>Using the Unity enviroment and engine and C# scripts I created a practice game to learn more about unity and C#. The game is a take of the classic breakout game created from scratch on unity. The game contained two levels, a start screen, 
                        a gameover screen and a highscore tracker. I created a simple physics engine of the balls velocity and how it bounces off the paddle and it's launch trajectory in C#. 
                        From there, I created the bricks on unity and added interactions with the ball and the brick in C#, which would cause the brick to break displaying a breaking animation. 
                        The brick would occasionally spawn a power up in the form of an extra life. The game tracked a highscore and would save previous highscore and challenge the player to break it, 
                        allowing the player to input their name once a new highscore is obtained. The primary goal of this project was to learn more about Unity and C# scripts, to get a more indepth idea of how the language and engine works, to help create 
                        more projects in the future using more advanced techniques.
