                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I created a portoflio website to present my bio, skills and experience in languages alongside my created projects. With this
                        website, I aim to promote myself stronger when applying to job applications, and give a healthy boost to making myself a better candidate
                        to hire. Alongside, I am also further refining my skills in Full Stack to keep my learning and studying always going and improving. This portfolio project is 
                        my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                    <h2>Arena Style Battle Game</h2>
                    <p>Using Java I created an Arena Style Battle Game for a school project. Using Object-Oriented Programming I tracked the players information, such as health, 
                        attack strength, experience, money and defense. Alongside the player information, I used Object-Oriented Programming to track information about the enemies and bosses in a simillar fashion. 
                        The game was designed for a Object-Oriented Modeling and Design course. The project was given full creativity to 
                        create any program we wished to creat while following guidelines the course required, such as the steps to creating an application. Alongside the project I created an 
                        Oral presentation showcasing the programs functionality alongside the guidelines the course required.
